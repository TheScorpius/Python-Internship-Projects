# Day 03 – ATM Simulation System

## Project Overview
This project simulates a basic ATM system using Python.
Users can log in with a PIN and perform banking operations
such as checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money.

## Concepts Used
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- User input handling
- Menu-driven program

## Project Structure
- atm.py – Main ATM simulation logic

## How to Run
1. Open terminal in this folder
2. Run:
   python atm.py

## Default Credentials
- PIN: 1234
- Initial Balance: ₹10,000

## Learning Outcomes
- Implementing real-world logic
- Loop-based program flow
- Input validation

## Status
